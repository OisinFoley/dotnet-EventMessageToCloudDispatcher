# Event Dispatcher Library

## Small library which can be embedded in an app to facilitate communication of messages to Azure via a Service Bus

## Requirements

- Just add a reference to this library in your app and send the correct parameters to the ctor

## Feature

- Event item classes are abstracted away from the event transmission logic in order to facilitate the option for adding further Cloud vendors in the future.
